# `gfx` — a platform-agnostic graphics backend for `id`

A windowed graphics backend, built the way the terminal engine was: a tiny set
of native primitives that `id` drives from its own frame loop. Where
`demos/engine` keeps an off-screen **character** buffer and flushes it to a
terminal with ANSI escapes, `gfx` keeps an off-screen **pixel** buffer and
presents it to a real OS window. The drawing logic stays in portable `id`; only
the window and the blit are native.

```sh
idc/bin/idc demos/gfxdemo --allow-untested -o gfxdemo && ./gfxdemo
# a 320x200 window with a sliding, color-cycling box. Close it (or Esc / q) to quit.
```

## The seam

The entire contract between `id` and the platform is [`gfx.h`](gfx.h) — five
integer-returning functions:

| function | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `gfx_open(w, h, title)`  | open a `w`×`h` window, return 1/0 |
| `gfx_present(fb)`        | blit the `int[]` pixel buffer (`0xRRGGBB`, row-major, top row first) and pump events |
| `gfx_poll()`             | one event, non-blocking: `-2` quit, `-1` none, `>=0` key code |
| `gfx_close()`            | tear the window down |

Both backends also honor `GFX_MAX_FRAMES`: if that environment variable is set
to a positive integer *N*, `gfx_present` counts calls and, once *N* have
happened, makes the *next* `gfx_poll()` report quit (`-2`). This lets a build
run headlessly (no human closing the window) for a bounded number of frames and
exit 0 — the mechanism used to validate this backend in CI/dev-shell runs.

`id` never names a platform API; it only calls these. That seam is exactly
`id`'s segmentation philosophy applied to portability: the platform-specific
code is quarantined behind a handful of names, and the whole rule-of-3 `id` tree
above it (`demos/gfxdemo`) is identical on every OS.

### Why these signatures

Each entry point is a `native` declaration in this directory's `.id` files
(`window.id`, `events.id`, `mouse.id`). `idc` merges them into the build like
any dependency, checks every call against them exactly as it checks a call to
an `id` function, and emits each as a C prototype `id_<name>(…)`. So every
backend entry point is named `id_*`, returns `int`, and
takes arguments lowered the way `idc` lowers them (`int`→`int`, `string`→`char*`,
`int[]`→`IdList*`). The framebuffer is passed as one `int[]` so a whole frame
crosses the boundary in a single call, not a million per-pixel ones — the same
"build the buffer, then flush once" shape the terminal engine uses.

## How it links

`idc` finds a backend by its `backend.id`, wherever a collected tree has one —
this one lives at `sys/win/gfx`, inside idstd, which is imported into every
build by default, so a program just calls `gfx_open` and the rest with no
`conf.id` import and no flag. A backend is compiled and linked only once a
build reaches one of its natives, so a program that never calls `gfx_open`
links no X11. `--backend DIR` is an override, not how a program gets this
backend: `DIR` holds a `backend.id` whose `name` matches an attached backend,
plus its sources and no declarations, and it replaces how that backend is
linked for the build. Nothing is hard-coded in the compiler — a backend is
self-describing, in `id` constant declarations that are read and never
compiled ([`backend.id`](backend.id)):

```
string name = "gfx";

string[] c_darwin_sources = ["gfx_macos.m"];
string[] c_darwin_cflags = ["-fobjc-arc"];
string[] c_darwin_link = ["-framework", "Cocoa", "-framework", "QuartzCore"];

string[] c_linux_sources = ["gfx_linux.c"];
string[] c_linux_cflags = [];
string[] c_linux_link = ["-lX11"];
```

## Platforms

- **macOS** ([`gfx_macos.m`](gfx_macos.m)) — Cocoa + QuartzCore via the system
  toolchain (no third-party libraries). A layer-backed `NSView` draws the
  framebuffer as a `CGImage`. `id` keeps its own loop, so the app is
  `finishLaunching`ed once and events are pumped non-blockingly with
  `nextEventMatchingMask:…distantPast` each frame. **Built and run.**
- **Linux** ([`gfx_linux.c`](gfx_linux.c)) — Xlib `XPutImage` over a software
  framebuffer, `-lX11` only. Same header, same contract; this is the concrete
  proof the seam is portable. **Validated**: built and run inside
  `tools/devshell.sh` against a live X server —
  `GFX_MAX_FRAMES=60 ./gfxdemo` presents 60 frames and exits 0. (Earlier drafts
  of this file were missing `#include <stdint.h>`, needed for the `uint32_t`
  pixel buffer; fixed as part of validating this path.)

Adding Windows (GDI/`StretchDIBits`) or a Wayland backend is one more source
file plus its `c_windows_*` or `c_linux_*` lines in `backend.id` — no change to
compiled `id` code or to the compiler.

## Path to true-native rendering

Today the only primitive is "present a software framebuffer," which is the most
portable floor and keeps all drawing in `id`. The header is built to grow a
second tier *without breaking the first*: add entry points like `gfx_rect`,
`gfx_blit`, or a GPU pipeline (Metal on macOS, Vulkan on Linux) backed
per-platform, while `gfx_present` stays as the always-available fallback. `id`
programs opt into the faster path by calling the new names; the framebuffer path
keeps working everywhere it always did.

**This second tier now exists**: [`sys/win/gl`](../gl/README.md) is a sibling
backend (same `gfx_open`/`gfx_poll`/`gfx_close`, a separate `backend.id`) that
adds a real GPU pipeline via GLX/OpenGL — `demos/gl3d` drives it to render a
spinning, per-vertex-shaded cube. It's a different backend directory rather
than new entry points bolted onto *this* header, which keeps `gfx.h` exactly as
simple as the day it validated the seam; both backends are attached by
default, so a program picks its floor (calling only `gfx_*`) or its ceiling
(calling `gl_*` too) simply by which functions it calls, and the frame-loop
shape (open → loop of draw/present/poll → close) is identical either way.

## Known rough edges (first slice)

- Backend functions are `native` declarations, emitted as real prototypes
  rather than K&R-style externs. Nothing yet checks that `gfx_linux.c`'s
  definitions match those declarations: the generated C does not include
  `gfx.h`, so the two are kept in agreement by hand.
- Window resize is now followed: `pump()` handles `ConfigureNotify` and
  reallocates the surface, and `gfx_width()`/`gfx_height()` report the live
  size. An `id` program must ask each frame and re-init its framebuffer when
  the answer changes — the surface follows the window, and a framebuffer that
  no longer matches is drawn into the top-left corner with black margins.
  There is no way to refuse a resize; a tiling window manager will impose one
  on map, before the first frame.
- Input now covers arrow keys, F-keys, Home/End/PgUp/PgDn/Insert/Delete, bare
  modifiers, and **key release** — see the key-code block in `gfx.h`. Codes
  0–255 are unchanged, so nothing written against the old contract moved.
  Auto-repeat is filtered, so "is this key held" is answerable for the first
  time.
- Pointer state is `gfx_mouse_x()`, `gfx_mouse_y()`, `gfx_mouse_buttons()` —
  state, not events, because a click is an edge and `id` can see an edge by
  comparing frames.
- **Audio: none.** There is no sound backend anywhere in the repo. It would be
  a new `backend.id` beside these two (`snd_open`, `snd_queue(int[])`), and
  it should be specified before it is built.
- `gfx_macos.m` implements the same extended contract, but **it has not been
  compiled or run**: the machine this work was done on is Linux. Treat it as a
  faithful translation awaiting a machine.
- `gfx.h`'s `IdList` must stay byte-identical to `idc.py`'s runtime `IdList`; if
  that layout ever changes, update both.
