/* gfx.h -- the `id` graphics backend ABI (the platform-agnostic seam).
 *
 * This header defines the *entire* contract between `id` programs and the
 * native window/present code. An `id` program never names a platform API; it
 * only calls these five functions, which `idc` resolves at link time against
 * one platform backend object (gfx_macos.m, gfx_linux.c, ...). Swapping the OS
 * swaps the object behind this header and nothing else -- the same way the
 * terminal engine abstracts over termios/ANSI behind put/getkey/flush.
 *
 * Design: a *software framebuffer*. The `id` side owns an `int[]` of w*h pixels
 * (one 0xRRGGBB value per pixel, row-major, top row first) and draws into it in
 * pure, portable `id`. Once per frame it hands the whole buffer to gfx_present,
 * which blits it to the window. All drawing logic stays in `id`; the backend
 * only opens a window, copies pixels, and reports input. This keeps the
 * per-platform code tiny and is the most portable possible seam.
 *
 * Path to true-native rendering: this same header is the place to grow a
 * second tier of entry points (gfx_rect, gfx_blit, a GPU pipeline, ...) backed
 * per-OS by Metal/Vulkan, while gfx_present stays as the always-available
 * software path. The framebuffer is the floor, not the ceiling.
 *
 * ABI notes:
 *   - Every entry point is a `native` declaration in this directory's .id
 *     files, which idc emits as a prototype and calls as `id_<name>(args)`. So
 *     each function here is named with the `id_` prefix, and its C signature
 *     must match that declaration.
 *   - Argument lowering mirrors idc's: `id` int -> C int, `id` string -> char*,
 *     `id` int[] -> IdList* (below). These match what idc emits at the call.

/* Growable list, byte-for-byte identical to the IdList in idc.py's RUNTIME.
 * An `id` `int[]` lowers to `IdList*`; each element is one cell. For an int
 * list the cell holds the int directly (only floats are bit-boxed), so a pixel
 * value is simply `(int)data[i]`. If idc's runtime layout ever changes, this
 * struct must change with it. */

/* -- key codes ------------------------------------------------------------
 * id_gfx_poll returns one int, so the codes share one space:
 *
 *     0 .. 255      a key that makes a character: its byte. Unchanged, so
 *                   every program written against the old contract still
 *                   reads the same values for letters, Return, Esc and so on.
 *     256 .. 511    a key that makes no character. XLookupString yields
 *                   nothing for these, which is why arrows, F-keys and bare
 *                   modifiers used to be invisible to `id` entirely.
 *     + GFX_RELEASED  the same code, released rather than pressed.
 *
 * So a program that only wants "which letter" keeps working untouched, one
 * that wants arrows tests against the names below, and one that wants "is
 * this key held" tracks presses and releases itself -- which it could not do
 * at all before, because releases were never reported. */
