/* gl.h -- the `id` hardware-accelerated graphics backend ABI.
 *
 * This is the second tier promised by sys/win/gfx/README.md's "path to
 * true-native rendering": where `gfx` presents a software framebuffer that
 * `id` paints one pixel at a time, `gl` hands the pixels to a real GPU. The
 * window/input primitives (gfx_open, gfx_poll, gfx_close) are the SAME names
 * and the SAME contract as sys/win/gfx/gfx.h on purpose -- an `id` program's
 * frame-loop shape doesn't change when it switches from the software floor to
 * the hardware path, only what it calls each frame to draw.
 *
 * ABI notes (same rules as gfx.h): every entry point is a `native`
 * declaration in this directory's .id files, which idc emits as a prototype
 * and calls as `id_<name>(args)`, so every function here returns `int`, is
 * named with the `id_` prefix, and takes only
 * argument types idc knows how to lower: `id` int -> C int, `id` int[] ->
 * IdList* (below). There is no `id` string arg on this second tier except the
 * window title, matching gfx.h.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The float problem, and how this backend solves it
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `id` cannot conveniently build the float matrices a GPU pipeline needs
 * (see demos/gl3d/README.md for the full rationale), so this backend follows
 * the division of labor the task calls "legitimate and clean": ALL matrix
 * math lives here, in C, using real `double`/`float` arithmetic. `id` only
 * ever passes and receives *integers*:
 *
 *   - angles and translations cross the seam as integers scaled by 1000
 *     ("milli-units"): an id int `y` meaning translate-by-y/1000.0 units, or
 *     `deg` meaning deg/1000.0 degrees. This mirrors demos/gfxdemo's own
 *     `rgb(r,g,b)` packing trick -- plain integer arithmetic standing in for
 *     something the language can't spell directly.
 *   - a built matrix is never marshalled back into `id` at all. Instead each
 *     gl_mat_* builder returns an opaque *handle*: a small int index into a
 *     fixed pool of 4x4 matrices kept entirely on the native side. `id` just
 *     threads handles between calls (gl_mat_mul(a, b) -> new handle, then
 *     gl_set_modelview(handle)). This is simpler than round-tripping 16
 *     bit-cast floats through an IdList* and just as legitimate a lowering.
 *   - vertex data (positions, colors) DOES cross as IdList* of int, but every
 *     element is either a milli-unit coordinate (divide by 1000.0 on this
 *     side to get the float) or a packed 0xRRGGBB color (same convention
 *     gfx.h's framebuffer already uses).
 *

 * The seam, function by function
