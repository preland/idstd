/* fs.h -- the C target's realisation of the `fs` backend ABI.
 *
 * The ABI itself lives in this directory's `native` declarations (handle.id,
 * data.id, path/), written in `id`'s types, because it is the part that is not
 * about C: an interpreter or an LLVM target has to provide the same functions
 * with the same meanings, and reads them from there. The compiler checks every
 * call against them. This header is one target's answer to that declaration -- the C
 * prototypes the object file exports -- and nothing above it (no `.id` file,
 * no compiler source) knows it exists.
 *
 * Why a backend at all, rather than builtins: adding `fs_*` to BUILTIN_NAMES
 * would mean implementing them once per code generator -- the C runtime, the
 * LLVM lowering, the wasm lowering -- and the C runtime is a string constant
 * inside `demos/idc_in_id_parse/back/out/sink/runtime.id`, so "add file
 * I/O" would have meant writing C into an `id` source file. As a backend the
 * implementation is C source in a C file, linked by whoever links.
 *
 * ABI notes:
 *   - Every entry point is a `native` declaration, which idc emits as the
 *     prototype `<ctype> id_<name>(<params>)` and calls as `id_<name>(args)`.
 *     So each function is named with the `id_` prefix; each returns `int`, so a
 *     size or a count tops out at INT_MAX, which is also true of every other
 *     length in `id` (`len` returns `int`).
 *   - Argument lowering mirrors idc's: `id` int -> C int, `id` string -> char*,
 *     `id` int[] -> IdList*.
 *
 * Why bytes cross as `int[]` rather than as an address in the flat store: the
 * store (`alloc`/`peek8`/`poke8`) is a `static` inside the *generated* program,
 * so a separately compiled object cannot reach it. A list is a pointer the id
 * side already owns and hands over -- the same seam gfx uses for a framebuffer.
