/* sock.h -- the `id` Unix-domain-socket backend ABI (Linux only).
 *
 * QMP -- the protocol tools/qmon speaks to QEMU -- is JSON lines over a
 * Unix-domain socket, and the socket does not exist until QEMU has booted
 * far enough to create it. `id` has no socket of any kind, so this backend
 * is the missing seam: connect (retrying until the path appears), send,
 * receive with a timeout, close.
 *
 * ABI notes, matching sys/io/fs/fs.h and sys/io/ipc/proc/proc.h:
 *   - Every entry point is a `native` declaration in this directory's .id
 *     files, named with the `id_` prefix, returning `int`; id_sock_error()
 *     fetches the errno behind a -1.
 *   - Argument lowering mirrors idc's: `id` int -> C int, `id` string ->
 *     char*, `id` int[] -> IdList* (below).
 *   - Bytes cross as `int[]`, one byte per cell, for the same reason fs_read
 *     and proc_read do: the flat store is unreachable from a separately
 *     compiled object.
