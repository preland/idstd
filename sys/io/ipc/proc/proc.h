/* proc.h -- the `id` child-process backend ABI (Linux only).
 *
 * The whole of `BUILTIN_NAMES` gives a program stdin, stdout and a filesystem
 * (through `fs`) but no way to start another process and watch it run, so a
 * tool that has to drive something long-lived -- QEMU, in `tools/qmon` --
 * could not exist in `id` at all. This backend is the missing seam: spawn,
 * read what it writes, wait for it with a timeout, kill it.
 *
 * ABI notes, matching sys/io/fs/fs.h:
 *   - Every entry point is a `native` declaration in this directory's .id
 *     files, so it is named with the `id_` prefix and returns `int`: a status
 *     fits one bit of room, hence -1 everywhere and id_proc_error() to fetch
 *     the errno behind it.
 *   - Argument lowering mirrors idc's: `id` int -> C int, `id` string ->
 *     char*, `id` int[] -> IdList* (below).
 *
 * Why argv is one newline-joined string rather than a `string[]`: idc's
 * native boundary only lowers int, int[] and a single string (see gfx.h and
 * gl.h -- "there is no id string arg on this second tier except the window
 * title"); a list of strings has no lowering at all, because an IdList cell
 * is one uniform 64-bit word and a string is not one. The caller builds the
 * line with idstd's str_join(argv, "\n"); this side splits on '\n'. None of
 * qmon's arguments can contain a newline, so the join is lossless.
 *
 * Why bytes read from the child cross as `int[]`: the same reason fs_read
 * does (fs.h) -- the flat store is a `static` inside the *generated* program,
 * unreachable from a separately compiled object, so a list the id side
 * already owns is the seam.
